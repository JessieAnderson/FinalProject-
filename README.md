# README For Final Propject in CIS 1415

To use my program, click "Run" then select "Run Module".

Enter an ID for "Student ID". Leaving this blank will not affect the rest of
the program.

Enter the program. Enter the Key from this dictionary:
programDict = {"AA":"2","RN":"2","LPN":"1.5","AMT":"3","MT":"1"}

For subsidized used, enter a float. Usually this would be 1.5 and 6.0

Click the enter button. This will update the box under "Max years of sub" label. If
the student is over the limit, a message will appear. Otherwise it will remain
blank.

In the date fields, this can be left as is, or updated based on the format
listed on the label. This part of the program calculates dates between two dates
which is something I hadn't done before.

Credits can be updated if student is enrolled in a different amount. When the
student is not enrolled yet, we assume full-time enrollment which is 12 credits.
Generally we would enter a whole number or half as we have some classes that can
be a half of a credit.

Click the enter button after this. The max sub eligibility field will update. A message
will appear at the bottom if the student is inelgible or if enrollment needs to
be changed. Sometimes we need process a loan for one term in order for the
student to receive subsidized loan.

The next fields need to be a number 0+. Click enter and below this will show
how to process the loan, whether in Fall and/or Spring and the amount.

At the bottom you can pick to open a text file which will open up under "File
Name". This stores IDs for those the user wants to review, again, in the future.
The user can also type IDs in here and save it by clicking the save button.

To clear all of the user input, click "new". The beginning and ending dates
will not update by doing this just in case the user is reviewng several
files with this date.
